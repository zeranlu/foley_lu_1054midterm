    <h2>Why you shouldn’t watch HORROR movies </h2>
    
      <p> Witnessing horrific scenes in horror movies can cause the viewer to be less sensitive to violence in general. Someone who watches horror movies may increase their threshold to stress/become scared. They may require increasingly horrifying visuals to become frightened. This desensitization may cause viewers to fail to respond appropriately in times of crises.

       Watching horror movies may cause some viewers to experience increased levels of anxiety and paranoia. Intrusive thoughts and imagery can linger in someone’s mind long after watching a horror movie. This anxiety and paranoia can easily be avoided by not watching a horror movie.

      <p>Horror movies cause unnecessary distress in the viewer's life. Regular life is difficult enough by itself. By watching horror movies, a viewer may develop a trigger that they would not normally encounter in their daily lives.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Horror movies MIGHT be good but they also MIGHT be bad. They really depend on the person. Some viewers might not want to live on the edge of such extreme visuals and storytelling. It might be too grotesque and violent or its gory substance might be too much to handle. On the other hand, someone who's does not mind the gross details of horror can find great pleasure in viewing them. </p>
