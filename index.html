      <h2>YES you SHOULD!</h2>
      <p>
        Horror movies have always existed just on the edge of societal norms. They are an anxious artform that breaks boundaries and transcends simple ideas into elevated forms of expression. The foundation of horror movies is in the unity of emotional responses in the audience. It achieves this form of dramatic engagement through contrasting themes, subversion of expectations, and abject disgust. Horror movies are truly the quintessential form of dramatic catharsis and should be appreciated as such.

<h4>REFLECT on your FEAR</h4>
<p>Horror movies make you reflect on your own fears that are buried in your subconscious. Deep intrapersonal reflections of the cause of anxieties and fears can elevate your sense of self. Watching horror movies engages your consciousness with your subconscious and makes you ask questions about why you fear something, the root cause of said fears, and how those subconscious fears affect your everyday life in ways that are not obvious. Therefore, watching horror movies are a good mental exercise that makes you a better person.</p>

<h4>FEAR TOGETHER</h4>
<p>Horror movies bring people together. The basis of this artform is to collect people together. It uses the concept of fear mongering panic amongst the masses to unify them into a state of expression and reflection with the usually present outrage and outbursts. Horror movies allow people to feel frightened together in a theater, on a couch, or in the seats of your car. They make people engage in conversation about why something was scary or why it wasn’t. The sense of community that horror movies bring forward is one that is self-constructive, self-reflective, and self-titillating. Therefore, horror movies are a necessity in good health and should be watched as often as possible to frequent this state of elevated existence.</p>
